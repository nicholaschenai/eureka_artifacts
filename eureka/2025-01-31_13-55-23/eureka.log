To solve the task of making the ant run forward as fast as possible, the reward function should primarily focus on the forward velocity of the ant. Additionally, a small penalty can be added for excessive energy usage or actions to encourage efficiency. Let's write the reward function with these considerations:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, actions: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]  # Extract linear velocity from root states
    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]  # Assuming forward direction is along the x-axis
    
    # Reward for forward velocity
    forward_velocity_reward = forward_velocity
    
    # Penalty for high action magnitudes (to promote efficiency)
    energy_penalty = torch.sum(actions**2, dim=-1)
    
    # Scaling energy penalty
    energy_temp = 0.1
    energy_penalty_scaled = torch.exp(-energy_temp * energy_penalty)
    
    # Total reward
    total_reward = forward_velocity_reward + energy_penalty_scaled
    
    # Reward components
    reward_dict = {
        "forward_velocity_reward": forward_velocity_reward,
        "energy_penalty_scaled": energy_penalty_scaled
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

In this function, I have assumed that the forward direction is along the x-axis of the velocity tensor. The `energy_penalty` is transformed with a softening exponential function to bound its contribution, promoting smoother actions.

[2025-01-31 14:26:06,767][root][INFO] - Iteration 0: User Content:
We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 50 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
forward_velocity_reward: ['0.01', '0.90', '1.42', '1.75', '2.35', '3.04', '3.72', '4.30', '4.70', '5.21'], Max: 5.83, Mean: 3.03, Min: 0.00 
energy_penalty_scaled: ['0.66', '0.71', '0.73', '0.74', '0.74', '0.75', '0.75', '0.75', '0.75', '0.75'], Max: 0.75, Mean: 0.74, Min: 0.66 
task_score: ['0.01', '0.90', '1.43', '1.75', '2.36', '3.05', '3.73', '4.30', '4.70', '5.21'], Max: 5.82, Mean: 3.03, Min: 0.01 
episode_lengths: ['46.67', '225.95', '328.56', '564.84', '716.73', '818.19', '899.59', '926.36', '940.65', '952.97'], Max: 978.80, Mean: 691.50, Min: 46.67 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Analyzing the policy feedback reveals several opportunities for improvement:

1. **Forward Velocity Reward:**
   - The values show significant increase, which is encouraging. However, we need to ensure it continues to drive improvement without saturating too early, so we will scale it down slightly so that energy efficiency becomes more prominent.

2. **Energy Penalty Scaled:**
   - The values are relatively stable and high, which means the penalty isn't significantly affecting behavior. We can try increasing the temperature in the exponential function to ensure penalties have a stronger effect.

Given these observations, here is the revised reward function:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, actions: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]  # Extract linear velocity from root states
    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]  # Assuming forward direction is along the x-axis

    # Reward for forward velocity, scaled
    velocity_scale = 0.5
    forward_velocity_reward = velocity_scale * forward_velocity
    
    # Enhanced penalty for high action magnitudes (to promote efficiency)
    energy_penalty = torch.sum(actions**2, dim=-1)
    
    # Increasing the energy temperature for stronger penalization
    energy_temp = 0.5  # Increased from 0.1 to 0.5
    energy_penalty_scaled = torch.exp(-energy_temp * energy_penalty)
    
    # Total reward
    total_reward = forward_velocity_reward + energy_penalty_scaled
    
    # Reward components
    reward_dict = {
        "forward_velocity_reward": forward_velocity_reward,
        "energy_penalty_scaled": energy_penalty_scaled
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

Changes:
- **Forward Velocity Reward Scale:** Reduced by scaling with `velocity_scale` to balance with other components.
- **Energy Penalty Temperature:** Increased `energy_temp` to 0.5 for stronger penalties, aiming to balance exploration in action space while promoting efficient movements. This should help optimize energy usage more effectively.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 50 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
forward_velocity_reward: ['0.01', '0.46', '0.93', '1.35', '1.81', '2.12', '2.43', '2.66', '2.86', '3.05'], Max: 3.30, Mean: 1.93, Min: 0.00

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Based on the policy feedback:

1. **Forward Velocity Reward:**
   - This component shows a healthy increase over each checkpoint, indicating that the agent is learning to move faster. However, we need to ensure that it is balanced well with other components.

2. **Energy Penalty Scaled:**
   - The values are relatively stable and don't show much change. This might suggest that the penalties aren't effectively discouraging inefficient actions. To address this, we can either increase the penalty weight or modify the function.

Given these observations, here's an improved reward function:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, actions: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract velocity from root states
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]
    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]  # Forward direction is along the x-axis

    # Scale the forward velocity reward to balance magnitude 
    forward_velocity_scale = 1.5  # Increased from previous scale
    forward_velocity_reward = forward_velocity_scale * forward_velocity
    
    # Energy penalty modification
    energy_penalty = torch.sum(actions**2, dim=-1)

    # Increase energy temperature to emphasize penalty
    energy_temp = 1.0  # High value to apply stronger penalization
    energy_penalty_scaled = -energy_temp * energy_penalty  # Direct linear scaling

    # Improved penalty weighting
    overall_temp = 0.1
    total_reward = torch.exp(overall_temp * (forward_velocity_reward + energy_penalty_scaled))
    
    # Reward components
    reward_dict = {
        "forward_velocity_reward": forward_velocity_reward,
        "energy_penalty_scaled": energy_penalty_scaled
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

Changes made:
- **Forward Velocity Reward Scale:** Increased `forward_velocity_scale` to 1.5 for ensuring its influence remains substantial.
- **Energy Penalty:**
  - Opted for a linear scaling of energy penalty for a straightforward impact.
  - Increased `energy_temp` to 1.0 to amplify penalization.
- **Total Reward Transformation:** Applied a global temperature parameter `overall_temp` that combines both components in an exponential manner to normalize the results and accentuate the primary goal of high forward velocity with efficient energy usage.

[2025-01-31 16:22:33,263][root][INFO] - Iteration 3: GPT Output Content:
Based on the policy feedback, here's a detailed analysis and suggestions:

1. **Forward Velocity Reward:**
   - Observations: The values showed an expected increase, reflecting that the agent is improving in moving forward quickly. However, while the maximum has increased, the impact needs to be more substantial given the task's goal.
   - Suggestion: Retain this reward but ensure its impact is emphasized.

2. **Energy Penalty Scaled:**
   - Observations: The energy penalty has a consistent value range, suggesting it may not be impactful enough in discouraging inefficient movements. The range is considerably smaller, indicating it might be outweighed by other components.
   - Suggestion: Increase the scale or the temperature parameter to enhance its influence or consider re-evaluating its effectiveness based on task relevance.

3. **Overall Task Score:**
   - Observations: The task score consistently increased, suggesting some measure of progress but also possible relic biases in the reward structure.
   - Suggestion: Aim to better balance components to avoid overly penalizing efficient but perhaps slower actions.

Here is a revised reward function taking these points into consideration:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, actions: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract velocity and compute forward velocity (positive x-axis)
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]
    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]

    # Enhanced forward velocity reward
    forward_velocity_scale = 2.0  # Slight increase to emphasize forward motion
    forward_velocity_reward = forward_velocity_scale * forward_velocity

    # Revised energy penalty
    energy_penalty = torch.sum(actions**2, dim=-1)
    energy_temp = 1.2  # Temperature adjustment for stronger impact
    energy_penalty_scaled = -energy_temp * energy_penalty

    # Consider an additional stability or efficiency factor (e.g., reduce abrupt actions)
    stable_motion_penalty = torch.sum((actions[:, 1:] - actions[:, :-1])**2, dim=-1)
    stable_motion_temp = 0.5
    stable_motion_penalty_scaled = -stable_motion_temp * stable_motion_penalty

    # Total reward combining all component with a moderate temp scaling
    overall_temp = 0.1
    total_reward = torch.exp(overall_temp * (forward_velocity_reward + energy_penalty_scaled + stable_motion_penalty_scaled))

    # Reward components
    reward_dict = {
        "forward_velocity_reward": forward_velocity_reward,
        "energy_penalty_scaled": energy_penalty_scaled,
        "stable_motion_penalty_scaled": stable_motion_penalty_scaled
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

**Analysis of Changes:**
- **Increased** forward velocity scale to improve the component's impact. This helps ensure that moving forward quickly is more heavily rewarded.
- **Strengthened** the energy penalty by increasing its temperature, encouraging the agent to explore more energy-efficient actions.
- **Introduced** a `stable_motion_penalty` to promote smoother and more efficient behavior over abrupt changes. This can benefit the agent by reducing unnecessary energy consumption and fostering controlled movements, contributing to task performance.
- **Overall blending** using a moderate temperature to balance between incentivizing desired behavior and penalizing inefficiencies.

[2025-01-31 16:22:33,263][root][INFO] - Iteration 3: User Content:
We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 50 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
forward_velocity_reward: ['0.02', '0.58', '4.99', '7.46', '9.46', '10.63', '11.88', '12.49', '12.73', '13.65'], Max: 14.21, Mean: 9.10, Min: -0.05 
energy_penalty_scaled: ['-4.99', '-1.77', '-1.28', '-1.25', '-1.19', '-1.18', '-1.16', '-1.26', '-1.21', '-1.23'], Max: -1.15, Mean: -1.45, Min: -4.99 
stable_motion_penalty_scaled: ['-3.63', '-1.18', '-0.85', '-0.82', '-0.78', '-0.78', '-0.78', '-0.84', '-0.80', '-0.82'], Max: -0.76, Mean: -0.98, Min: -3.63 
task_score: ['0.01', '0.29', '2.49', '3.73', '4.73', '5.31', '5.94', '6.24', '6.35', '6.82'], Max: 7.09, Mean: 4.55, Min: -0.03 
episode_lengths: ['47.00', '331.57', '867.58', '974.20', '956.78', '870.67', '920.43', '935.94', '950.98', '960.51'], Max: 994.87, Mean: 833.29, Min: 47.00 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Let's analyze the policy feedback and adjust our reward function based on its performance:

1. **Forward Velocity Reward:**
   - Observations: The mean has improved over time and reached a considerable value. The potential for this reward is promising; however, it might still be needed to further incentivize forward movement by increasing its influence.
   - Suggestion: Maintain an increased scale to further emphasize the importance of forward velocity.

2. **Energy Penalty Scaled:**
   - Observations: The penalty has a narrow range and hasn't optimized much, slightly impacting minimizing energy waste.
   - Suggestion: Adjust the temperature scale to make it more impactful.

3. **Stable Motion Penalty Scaled:**
   - Observations: It has had moderate but consistent improvements, encouraging smoother motion.
   - Suggestion: Scale might still be slightly lower, but it appears to influence the agent. Consider re-scaling to ensure it doesn't overshadow or get overshadowed by other components.

4. **Overall Task Performance:**
   - Observations: Task score has consistently increased while episode lengths suggest the agent sustains longer running.
   - Suggestion: Potential scalings could still be off, needing careful balance for task success.

Here's an updated reward function considering the analysis:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, actions: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract velocity and compute forward velocity (positive x-axis)
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]
    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]

    # Adjusted forward velocity reward
    forward_velocity_scale = 2.5  # Further emphasized
    forward_velocity_reward = forward_velocity_scale * forward_velocity

    # Adjusted energy penalty
    energy_penalty = torch.sum(actions**2, dim=-1)
    energy_temp = 1.4  # Strengthened for better impact
    energy_penalty_scaled = -energy_temp * energy_penalty

    # Adjusted stability penalty to ensure smoother motion
    stable_motion_penalty = torch.sum((actions[:, 1:] - actions[:, :-1])**2, dim=-1)
    stable_motion_temp = 0.8  # Moderate scale
    stable_motion_penalty_scaled = -stable_motion_temp * stable_motion_penalty

    # Overall reward calculation combining all components
    overall_temp = 0.15  # Slightly increased temperature for balancing reward components
    total_reward = torch.exp(overall_temp * (forward_velocity_reward + energy_penalty_scaled + stable_motion_penalty_scaled))

    # Reward components
    reward_dict = {
        "forward_velocity_reward": forward_velocity_reward,
        "energy_penalty_scaled": energy_penalty_scaled,
        "stable_motion_penalty_scaled": stable_motion_penalty_scaled
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

**Explanations for Adjustments:**
- The **forward velocity scale** is further increased in its weighting to prioritize speed.
- The **energy penalty's scaling** via temperature is strengthened to better penalize high energy usage.
- The **stable motion penalty scale** is cautiously adjusted to account for smoother transitions, preventing abrupt actions.
- The **overall temperature scale** sees a slight increment to cohesively boost the effectiveness of the adjustments for a balanced total reward computation.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 50 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
forward_velocity_reward: ['0.03', '1.26', '7.73', '12.40', '16.21', '17.87', '19.03', '19.97', '20.74', '21.24'], Max: 21.54, Mean: 14.66, Min: -0.05 
energy_penalty_scaled: ['-5.82', '-1.51', '-1.43', '-1.54', '-1.55', '-1.59', '-1.63', '-1.69', '-1.68', '-1.75'], Max: -1.31, Mean: -1.77, Min: -5.82 
stable_motion_penalty_scaled: ['-5.81', '-1.41', '-1.15', '-1.14', '-1.11', '-1.09', '-1.04', '-1.05', '-1.02', '-1.07'], Max: -0.98, Mean: -1.31, Min: -5.81 
task_score: ['0.01', '0.50', '3.09', '4.95', '6.47', '7.15', '7.60', '7.97', '8.28', '8.50'], Max: 8.61, Mean: 5.86, Min: -0.02 
episode_lengths: ['46.60', '402.84', '780.78', '877.25', '868.31', '857.32', '859.38', '890.34', '905.32', '888.72'], Max: 936.91, Mean: 781.27, Min: 46.60 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
