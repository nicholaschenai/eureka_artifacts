        "content": "You are a reward engineer trying to write reward functions to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effective as possible.\nYour goal is to write a reward function for the environment that will help the agent learn the task described in text. \nYour reward function should use useful variables from the environment as inputs. As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.\n"

The potential for this reward is promising; however, it might still be needed to further incentivize forward movement by increasing its influence.\n   - Suggestion: Maintain an increased scale to further emphasize the importance of forward velocity.\n\n2. **Energy Penalty Scaled:**\n   - Observations: The penalty has a narrow range and hasn't optimized much, slightly impacting minimizing energy waste.\n   - Suggestion: Adjust the temperature scale to make it more impactful.\n\n3. **Stable Motion Penalty Scaled:**\n   - Observations: It has had moderate but consistent improvements, encouraging smoother motion.\n   - Suggestion: Scale might still be slightly lower, but it appears to influence the agent. Consider re-scaling to ensure it doesn't overshadow or get overshadowed by other components.\n\n4. **Overall Task Performance:**\n   - Observations: Task score has consistently increased while episode lengths suggest the agent sustains longer running.\n   - Suggestion: Potential scalings could still be off, needing careful balance for task success.\n\nHere's an updated reward function considering the analysis:\n\n```python\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, actions: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Extract velocity and compute forward velocity (positive x-axis)\n    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]\n    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]\n\n    # Adjusted forward velocity reward\n    forward_velocity_scale = 2.5  # Further emphasized\n    forward_velocity_reward = forward_velocity_scale * forward_velocity\n\n    # Adjusted energy penalty\n    energy_penalty = torch.sum(actions**2, dim=-1)\n    energy_temp = 1.4  # Strengthened for better impact\n    energy_penalty_scaled = -energy_temp * energy_penalty\n\n    # Adjusted stability penalty to ensure smoother motion\n    stable_motion_penalty = torch.sum((actions[:, 1:] - actions[:, :-1])**2, dim=-1)\n    stable_motion_temp = 0.8  # Moderate scale\n    stable_motion_penalty_scaled = -stable_motion_temp * stable_motion_penalty\n\n    # Overall reward calculation combining all components\n    overall_temp = 0.15  # Slightly increased temperature for balancing reward components\n    total_reward = torch.exp(overall_temp * (forward_velocity_reward + energy_penalty_scaled + stable_motion_penalty_scaled))\n\n    # Reward components\n    reward_dict = {\n        \"forward_velocity_reward\": forward_velocity_reward,\n        \"energy_penalty_scaled\": energy_penalty_scaled,\n        \"stable_motion_penalty_scaled\": stable_motion_penalty_scaled\n    }\n\n    return total_reward, reward_dict\n```\n\n**Explanations for Adjustments:**\n- The **forward velocity scale** is further increased in its weighting to prioritize speed.\n- The **energy penalty's scaling** via temperature is strengthened to better penalize high energy usage.\n- The **stable motion penalty scale** is cautiously adjusted to account for smoother transitions, preventing abrupt actions.\n- The **overall temperature scale** sees a slight increment to cohesively boost the effectiveness of the adjustments for a balanced total reward computation."
