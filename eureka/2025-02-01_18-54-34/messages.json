        "content": "You are a reward engineer trying to write reward functions to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effective as possible.\nYour goal is to write a reward function for the environment that will help the agent learn the task described in text. \nYour reward function should use useful variables from the environment as inputs. As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.\n"

        "content": "Based on the feedback from the policy training, the following analysis and improvements are proposed:\n\n### Analysis\n1. **Forward Reward:**\n   - The forward_reward component is showing positive growth, suggesting effective driving towards the goal. However, the range is relatively narrow, so increased scaling or transformation may further enhance learning.\n\n2. **Enhanced Sideways Penalty:**\n   - The values are very close to each other and do not show significant variance, hinting at inefficiency in penalization. This component may need a complete rewrite to be more impactful or should be discarded if it does not substantially contribute.\n\n3. **Transformed Forward Reward:**\n   - The values show notable improvement and differentiation, indicating that this transformation is effective. Further fine-tuning of the temperature could improve effectiveness.\n\n4. **Transformed Sideways Penalty:**\n   - As with the enhanced sideways penalty, this component shows minimal variance and low magnitude, requiring re-assessment.\n\n5. **Overall Task Score and Episode Length:**\n   - The task score is improving, but there is still potential for further advancement if distractions are minimized.\n   - The episode lengths have increased significantly, suggesting potential issues with reward balancing or task exploration-exploitation balance needing re-tuning.\n\n### Recommendations\n1. Consider enhancing forward reward scaling.\n2. Rewrite enhanced sideways penalty for better variance and impact.\n3. Re-evaluate or discard transformed sideways penalty if no effective revision is possible.\n\n### Revised Reward Function\n\n```python\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, dt: float) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    device = root_states.device\n    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]\n    \n    # Calculate forward velocity\n    forward_velocity = velocity[:, 0]\n    max_speed = 15.0  # max normalized speed for scaling purposes\n    \n    # Forward Reward: boost scaling further for higher impact\n    forward_reward = forward_velocity.clamp(min=0) / max_speed\n    temperature_forward = 1.8\n    transformed_forward_reward = torch.exp(temperature_forward * forward_reward) - 1.0\n\n    # Rewriting sideways penalty to inject higher variance\n    angle_deviation = torch.norm(velocity[:, 1:3], p=2, dim=-1)  # Penalize yaw along with sideways motion\n    rewritten_sideways_penalty = -angle_deviation / max_speed  # Normalize with max_speed\n    temperature_sideways = 0.7\n    transformed_sideways_penalty = torch.exp(temperature_sideways * rewritten_sideways_penalty) - 1.0\n    \n    # New Total Reward\n    total_reward = transformed_forward_reward + transformed_sideways_penalty\n\n    return total_reward, {\n        \"forward_reward\": forward_reward,\n        \"rewritten_sideways_penalty\": rewritten_sideways_penalty,\n        \"transformed_forward_reward\": transformed_forward_reward,\n        \"transformed_sideways_penalty\": transformed_sideways_penalty\n    }\n```\n\n### Key Changes\n- Increased temperature_scaling for both transformations to enhance the shaping of learning.\n- Revised sideways penalty aims to promote variance and punish unwanted deviations effectively.\n- The focus on forward progression continues to be emphasized for swift target-reaching behavior.\n\nThis refined approach aims to strategically address the feedback and drive more effective learning by adjusting reward scales and transformations."
