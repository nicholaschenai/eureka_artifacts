To define a reward function for the task of opening the cabinet door, we focus on variables related to the position and movement of the agent's hand (Franka robot) and the cabinet door. The objective is to incentivize the robot's hand to reach and pull the cabinet handle effectively. Here's how the reward function can be structured:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(
    franka_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor, 
    drawer_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor, 
    cabinet_dof_pos: torch.Tensor, 
    cabinet_dof_vel: torch.Tensor
) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Reward component for minimizing the distance between the robot hand and the drawer handle
    distance_to_handle = torch.norm(franka_grasp_pos - drawer_grasp_pos, dim=-1)
    dist_to_handle_reward = -distance_to_handle

    # Reward component for opening the cabinet door (measured by the joint position of the door)
    door_opening_reward = cabinet_dof_pos[:, 3]  # Assuming index 3 corresponds to the door position

    # Reward component for velocity of the door opening (positive for opening direction)
    door_velocity_reward = cabinet_dof_vel[:, 3]  # Assuming index 3 corresponds to the door velocity

    # Transform the distance reward using a temperature parameter
    temperature_distance = 0.1  # This value can be tuned
    transformed_dist_reward = torch.exp(dist_to_handle_reward / temperature_distance)

    # Combine all reward components
    total_reward = 0.5 * transformed_dist_reward + 1.0 * door_opening_reward + 0.5 * door_velocity_reward

    # Collect the individual components in a dictionary
    reward_components = {
        "distance_to_handle": dist_to_handle_reward,
        "door_opening": door_opening_reward,
        "door_velocity": door_velocity_reward,
        "transformed_distance_reward": transformed_dist_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

This reward function focuses on three main aspects:
1. **Distance to handle**: By reducing the distance between the robot's hand and the drawer handle, we incentivize the robot to reach towards the handle.
2. **Door opening**: Rewarding the position of the door joint when it opens increases the incentive to successfully open the door.
3. **Door velocity**: Encourages the movement of the door in a positive direction to ensure it is opening.

The distance reward is transformed using `torch.exp` with a temperature parameter to moderate its influence. This transformation can help to handle diminishing returns as the robot reaches closer to the target point.

[2025-02-13 14:49:29,670][root][INFO] - Iteration 0: User Content:
We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 150 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
distance_to_handle: ['-0.47', '-0.01', '-0.01', '-0.01', '-0.01', '-0.35', '-0.01', '-0.55', '-0.01', '-0.02'], Max: -0.01, Mean: -0.08, Min: -1.48 
door_opening: ['0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00'], Max: 0.03, Mean: 0.00, Min: 0.00 
door_velocity: ['0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00'], Max: 0.03, Mean: 0.00, Min: -0.01 
transformed_distance_reward: ['0.01', '0.88', '0.90', '0.89', '0.88', '0.04', '0.89', '0.06', '0.86', '0.86'], Max: 0.90, Mean: 0.75, Min: 0.00 
task_score: ['0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00'], Max: 0.01, Mean: 0.00, Min: 0.00 
episode_lengths: ['312.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00', '500.00'], Max: 500.00, Mean: 497.95, Min: 312.00 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Analyzing the policy feedback indicates several key issues with the current reward function:

1. **Distance to Handle Reward**: The values are quite low (negative) and stable, indicating that this component dominates due to the transformation applied and the reward structure not effectively guiding the hand to the handle.

2. **Door Opening and Velocity Rewards**: Both components show negligible influence, as their values are consistently zero. This suggests these components are ineffective in their current form, perhaps because the agent doesn't get a sufficient reward to reach and pull the handle.

3. **Transformed Distance Reward**: While more variable, the values are still relatively low, illustrating a minimal incentive for the policy towards optimal action.

4. **Overall Policy Performance**: The nearly zero task success rate and long episode lengths indicate that the agent struggles to make progress on the task.

To improve the reward function, it would be beneficial to:

- **Redesign** the reward components to better align with the task objectives.
- **Rescale** or **disregard** ineffective components.
- **Apply transformations** where necessary with appropriate temperature scaling.

Here's a revised reward function incorporating these considerations:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(
    franka_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor, 
    drawer_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor, 
    cabinet_dof_pos: torch.Tensor, 
    cabinet_dof_vel: torch.Tensor
) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Reward component for minimizing the distance between the robot hand and the drawer handle
    distance_to_handle = torch.norm(franka_grasp_pos - drawer_grasp_pos, dim=-1)
    temperature_distance = 0.2  # Adjusted temperature parameter for scaling
    dist_reward = torch.exp(-distance_to_handle / temperature_distance)

    # Reward for any motion that indicates the door is opening
    opening_restored = cabinet_dof_pos[:, 3].clamp(min=0.0)
    opening_restored_reward = opening_restored * 2.0  # Multiply to scale the effect

    # Velocity indicating door movement in the opening direction
    velocity_reward = torch.clamp(cabinet_dof_vel[:, 3], min=0.0) * 1.5  # Adjusted reward scaling

    # Combine all reward components
    total_reward = 0.5 * dist_reward + 1.0 * opening_restored_reward + 1.0 * velocity_reward

    # Collect each individual component in a dictionary
    reward_components = {
        "dist_reward": dist_reward,
        "opening_restored_reward": opening_restored_reward,
        "velocity_reward": velocity_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Key Changes
1. **Redesigned Distance Component**: Instead of minimizing distance directly, it’s transformed with an adjusted temperature, providing a more nuanced and trailing reward as the hand approaches the drawer.

2. **Scaled Door Rewards**: Both door opening and velocity rewards are more heavily weighted and importantly focus not only on positive movement (i.e., actually opening the door) but also rescaling to emphasize tangible movements along the task objective. 

Overall, the goal of these modifications is to incentivize precise movements that align with achieving the task effectively. As always, real-world tuning may still be necessary to find optimal temperature and scaling parameters.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 150 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
dist_reward: ['0.11', '0.55', '0.53', '0.47', '0.29', '0.54', '0.44', '0.44', '0.23', '0.47'], Max: 0.74, Mean: 0.46, Min: 0.09 
opening_restored_reward: ['0.00', '0.63', '0.64', '0.62', '0.61', '0.58', '0.67', '0.67', '0.65', '0.62'], Max: 0.70, Mean: 0.62, Min: 0.00 
velocity_reward: ['0.00', '0.03', '0.03', '0.07', '0.06', '0.07', '0.07', '0.07', '0.07', '0.09'], Max: 0.60, Mean: 0.07, Min: 0.00 
task_score: ['0.00', '0.09', '0.05', '0.07', '0.06', '0.04', '0.05', '0.03', '0.04', '0.01'], Max: 0.44, Mean: 0.06, Min: 0.00 
episode_lengths: ['223.00', '480.06', '479.05', '482.33', '493.88', '487.66', '491.94', '495.69', '488.67', '491.44'], Max: 500.00, Mean: 475.70, Min: 125.12 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

From the policy feedback, it's evident that several issues with the reward function are present:

1. **Distance Reward**: The values are low and don't vary much, indicating the current transformation does not effectively prioritize reducing distance between the hand and the handle.

2. **Opening Restored Reward**: While showing higher values, they are relatively stable, hinting that door opening is somewhat achieved but with likely insufficient encouragement for further exploration or precision in opening.

3. **Velocity Reward**: These values are minimal and don't vary significantly, indicating this component doesn't provide significant benefit in its current form.

4. **Task Score and Episode Lengths**: Task success remains low, with episodes being overly long, suggesting inefficient learning or policy execution.

To address these issues, I will redesign and re-implement the reward components to better guide the policy towards successful task completion. I will provide an entirely new reward function with adjusted transformations and scaling:

### Key Improvements:

1. **Revised Distance Reward**: I reduced the temperature to make the reward more sensitive to changes in proximity, thereby promoting finer grasp precision.

2. **Enhanced Opening Reward**: Switched to a `tanh` transformation, maximizing the reward when the door is fully open while still encouraging substantial opening with an increased multiplier.

3. **Amplified Velocity Reward**: Applied an `exp` transformation to prioritize consistent velocity while encouraging steady door movement, with balanced scaling.

These changes aim to offer stronger and more appropriately scaled incentives for each aspect of the task, potentially leading to improved learning outcomes and higher task success rates.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 150 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
dist_reward: ['0.01', '0.08', '0.25', '0.10', '0.07', '0.02', '0.02', '0.02', '0.05', '0.06'], Max: 0.36, Mean: 0.08, Min: 0.00

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Based on the policy feedback, here's the analysis for each existing reward component:

1. **Distance Reward**:
   - The max value achieved is low (0.36), with a small range and a mean of 0.08. This suggests the transformation isn't effective. 
   - The temperature might be too high, providing inadequate distinction in proximity changes. A re-writing or re-scaling is needed to accentuate the grasping behavior.

2. **Opening Restored Reward**:
   - Values are very low, with a max of 0.53 and a mean of 0.02. This indicates that door opening isn't being effectively rewarded. 
   - Consider employing a more aggressive transformation or reworking the reward to encourage the desired outcome more strongly.

3. **Velocity Reward**:
   - The values are disproportionately large, with a max of 743.06 and mean of 10.58. This overshadows other components, skewing the learning process.
   - Rescale this reward to ensure balance among components.

Given these insights, I will rewrite the reward function with new components and transformations where necessary.

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(
    franka_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor,
    drawer_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor,
    cabinet_dof_pos: torch.Tensor,
    cabinet_dof_vel: torch.Tensor
) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    
    # Re-scaled and re-designed distance reward to encourage grasping
    distance_to_handle = torch.norm(franka_grasp_pos - drawer_grasp_pos, dim=-1) + 1e-6  # Ensure no division by zero
    temperature_distance = 0.2  # Adjusted for more sensitivity
    dist_reward = torch.exp(-distance_to_handle / temperature_distance) * 2.0  # Scaled up

    # Stronger incentive for door opening
    door_open_value = cabinet_dof_pos[:, 3]  # Range modification - focus on opening
    temperature_opening = 0.1
    opening_restored_reward = torch.exp(torch.abs(door_open_value) / temperature_opening) * 5.0  # Greater differentiation and scaling

    # Rebalanced velocity reward
    door_velocity = torch.abs(cabinet_dof_vel[:, 3])
    temperature_velocity = 1.0  # Greater temperature for finer gradients
    velocity_reward = torch.exp(-door_velocity / temperature_velocity)  # Brought down for balance

    # Compose the total reward
    total_reward = 1.0 * dist_reward + 2.0 * opening_restored_reward + 1.0 * velocity_reward

    # Dictionary with individual components for detailed analysis
    reward_components = {
        "dist_reward": dist_reward,
        "opening_restored_reward": opening_restored_reward,
        "velocity_reward": velocity_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Key Adjustments:

- **Distance Reward**: Increased sensitivity by adjusting the exponent's temperature and scaled up the value to afford more attention to this component.

- **Opening Reward**: Applied a more aggressive `exp` transformation with a smaller temperature to drive the agent towards consistent door opening, multiplying the component further.

- **Velocity Reward**: Re-scaled to prevent overshadowing other components by using a higher temperature and reversing the transformation to reduce its magnitude.

These improvements aim for better distribution and guidance across all reward components, fostering effective learning paths and progress in task success.

Here's the analysis for each existing reward component based on feedback and proposed improvements:

1. **Distance Reward**:
   - Max and mean values are relatively low compared to other components. This suggests the reward is not driving significant behavior change.
   - Consider scaling up this reward or adjusting its transformation to more effectively encourage grasping actions.

2. **Opening Restored Reward**:
   - This component dominates with a max of 187.24 and mean of 145.25, overshadowing others and causing imbalance.
   - It should be re-scaled down to harmonize with other components. 

3. **Velocity Reward**:
   - Appears essentially constant (mean 0.96 across most epochs), indicating it may not be effectively contributing.
   - Rebalance this reward component to allow for meaningful variations or consider removing it if it doesn't materially influence learning.

4. **Task Score**:
   - Consistently very low, aligning with the low opening success rate.
   - This collectively with long episode lengths suggests that our reward structure isn't efficiently promoting task completion.

Based on these observations, I will reconstruct the reward function with modifications for improved learning outcomes:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(
    franka_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor,
    drawer_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor,
    cabinet_dof_pos: torch.Tensor,
    cabinet_dof_vel: torch.Tensor
) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:

    # Distance Reward: Encouraging the agent to close the distance to the handle.
    distance_to_handle = torch.norm(franka_grasp_pos - drawer_grasp_pos, dim=-1) + 1e-6
    temperature_distance = 0.5
    dist_reward = torch.exp(-distance_to_handle / temperature_distance)

    # Opening Reward: Rebalanced to integrate more naturally with other components.
    door_open_value = torch.abs(cabinet_dof_pos[:, 3])
    temperature_opening = 0.5
    opening_reward = torch.exp(door_open_value / temperature_opening)

    # New Component: Reward for maintaining drawer velocity within a moderate range to promote sustained opening.
    desired_velocity_low = 0.1
    desired_velocity_high = 0.5
    velocity_margin = torch.abs(cabinet_dof_vel[:, 3] - desired_velocity_low) + 1e-6
    velocity_margin = torch.clamp(velocity_margin, min=0, max=desired_velocity_high - desired_velocity_low)
    temperature_velocity = 0.5
    velocity_reward = torch.exp(-velocity_margin / temperature_velocity)

    # Total Reward: Harmoniously combining components for balanced learning.
    total_reward = 1.0 * dist_reward + 3.0 * opening_reward + 1.0 * velocity_reward

    # Store each component in the dict for detailed result analysis.
    reward_components = {
        "dist_reward": dist_reward,
        "opening_reward": opening_reward,
        "velocity_reward": velocity_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

### Key Adjustments:

- **Distance Reward**: Slightly increased temperature parameter to make it a more distinct influencer in agent behavior, capturing variations in the approach more effectively.

- **Opening Reward**: Rescaled to better balance with the distance and velocity components, creating a more integrated learning incentive structure.

- **Velocity Reward**: Adjusted to reward moderate sustained velocities, contributing to effective cabinet opening without overly dominating the task score.

- **Reduced Emphasis on Excessive Velocity**: Balancing overall magnitudes and temperatures across components should cultivate an environment more conducive to task success and learning efficiency, ideally addressing policy issues noted in feedback.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 150 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
dist_reward: ['0.40', '0.77', '0.43', '0.60', '0.69', '0.63', '0.51', '0.33', '0.39', '0.47'], Max: 0.88, Mean: 0.56, Min: 0.25 
opening_reward: ['1.00', '1.04', '1.65', '1.85', '1.91', '1.35', '2.03', '2.04', '2.03', '1.77'], Max: 2.09, Mean: 1.72, Min: 1.00 
velocity_reward: ['0.82', '0.82', '0.82', '0.81', '0.84', '0.82', '0.81', '0.81', '0.81', '0.81'], Max: 0.89, Mean: 0.80, Min: 0.57 
task_score: ['0.00', '0.00', '0.07', '0.02', '0.02', '0.01', '0.02', '0.02', '0.03', '0.02'], Max: 0.07, Mean: 0.02, Min: 0.00

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
