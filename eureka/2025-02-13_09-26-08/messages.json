As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.).

This suggests the reward is not driving significant behavior change.\n   - Consider scaling up this reward or adjusting its transformation to more effectively encourage grasping actions.\n\n2. **Opening Restored Reward**:\n   - This component dominates with a max of 187.24 and mean of 145.25, overshadowing others and causing imbalance.\n   - It should be re-scaled down to harmonize with other components. \n\n3. **Velocity Reward**:\n   - Appears essentially constant (mean 0.96 across most epochs), indicating it may not be effectively contributing.\n   - Rebalance this reward component to allow for meaningful variations or consider removing it if it doesn't materially influence learning.\n\n4. **Task Score**:\n   - Consistently very low, aligning with the low opening success rate.\n   - This collectively with long episode lengths suggests that our reward structure isn't efficiently promoting task completion.\n\nBased on these observations, I will reconstruct the reward function with modifications for improved learning outcomes:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Tuple, Dict\n\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(\n    franka_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor,\n    drawer_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor,\n    cabinet_dof_pos: torch.Tensor,\n    cabinet_dof_vel: torch.Tensor\n) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n\n    # Distance Reward: Encouraging the agent to close the distance to the handle.\n    distance_to_handle = torch.norm(franka_grasp_pos - drawer_grasp_pos, dim=-1) + 1e-6\n    temperature_distance = 0.5\n    dist_reward = torch.exp(-distance_to_handle / temperature_distance)\n\n    # Opening Reward: Rebalanced to integrate more naturally with other components.\n    door_open_value = torch.abs(cabinet_dof_pos[:, 3])\n    temperature_opening = 0.5\n    opening_reward = torch.exp(door_open_value / temperature_opening)\n\n    # New Component: Reward for maintaining drawer velocity within a moderate range to promote sustained opening.\n    desired_velocity_low = 0.1\n    desired_velocity_high = 0.5\n    velocity_margin = torch.abs(cabinet_dof_vel[:, 3] - desired_velocity_low) + 1e-6\n    velocity_margin = torch.clamp(velocity_margin, min=0, max=desired_velocity_high - desired_velocity_low)\n    temperature_velocity = 0.5\n    velocity_reward = torch.exp(-velocity_margin / temperature_velocity)\n\n    # Total Reward: Harmoniously combining components for balanced learning.\n    total_reward = 1.0 * dist_reward + 3.0 * opening_reward + 1.0 * velocity_reward\n\n    # Store each component in the dict for detailed result analysis.\n    reward_components = {\n        \"dist_reward\": dist_reward,\n        \"opening_reward\": opening_reward,\n        \"velocity_reward\": velocity_reward\n    }\n\n    return total_reward, reward_components\n```\n\n### Key Adjustments:\n\n- **Distance Reward**: Slightly increased temperature parameter to make it a more distinct influencer in agent behavior, capturing variations in the approach more effectively.\n\n- **Opening Reward**: Rescaled to better balance with the distance and velocity components, creating a more integrated learning incentive structure.\n\n- **Velocity Reward**: Adjusted to reward moderate sustained velocities, contributing to effective cabinet opening without overly dominating the task score.\n\n- **Reduced Emphasis on Excessive Velocity**: Balancing overall magnitudes and temperatures across components should cultivate an environment more conducive to task success and learning efficiency, ideally addressing policy issues noted in feedback."
