As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.\n"

        "content": "Based on the provided feedback, let's analyze each component of the reward function:\n\n1. **Forward Velocity Reward**:\n   - Strong upward trend but plateaus towards the end. This indicates a good push towards the goal but possibly a limit due to lack of balancing or overly aggressive actions. Slightly higher penalties might be needed for instability.\n\n2. **Upright Reward**:\n   - Values are very low and almost unchanged, indicating little impact. This suggests it might not effectively encourage a proper upright posture. A reevaluation with a stronger or more dynamic component might be in order.\n\n3. **Stability Reward**:\n   - Values show minor variations, suggesting insufficient sensitivity to variations in smoothness. Consider reformulating to better incentivize continuous and stable control.\n\n4. **Global Metrics**:\n   - Success rates and episode lengths showcase significant early improvements, indicating a generally sound system. However, lengths plateauing below maximum suggest inconsistencies perhaps due to small stability issues or a need for more explorative policies.\n\nConsidering these insights, we'll make the following adjustments and improvements to the reward function:\n\n- **Forward Velocity Reward**: Continue using the exponential transformation but adjust the temperature for a sharper reward to promote greater speeds.\n- **Upright Reward**: Reformulate entirely using a different approach, such as relative angle between up_vec and desired orientation vector, and increase its influence.\n- **Stability Reward**: Increase sensitivity by adjusting temperature and look for other cues on control stability.\n\nHere's the refined reward function:\n\n```python\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, potentials: torch.Tensor, prev_potentials: torch.Tensor, up_vec: torch.Tensor, heading_vec: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Extract components from the state\n    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]\n    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]\n    ang_velocity = root_states[:, 10:13]\n\n    # Forward Velocity Reward\n    to_target = targets - torso_position\n    to_target[:, 2] = 0.0\n    target_direction = torch.nn.functional.normalize(to_target, dim=-1)\n    forward_vel = torch.sum(velocity * target_direction, dim=-1)\n    forward_vel_temperature = 0.25  # Adjusted for sharper reward\n    forward_vel_reward = torch.exp(forward_vel_temperature * forward_vel) - 1.0\n\n    # New Upright Reward\n    upright_temperature = 1.5  # Strong encouragement for consistent posture\n    up_vector_expected = torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0, 1.0], device=root_states.device).expand_as(up_vec)\n    upright_similarity = torch.sum(up_vec * up_vector_expected, dim=-1)\n    upright_reward = torch.exp(upright_temperature * (upright_similarity - 1.0))\n\n    # Stability Reward\n    stability_temperature = 0.5  # Fine-tuned to promote reduced angular velocities\n    stability_reward = torch.exp(-stability_temperature * torch.norm(ang_velocity, p=2, dim=-1))\n\n    # Total Reward\n    total_reward = 1.0 * forward_vel_reward + 0.3 * upright_reward + 0.2 * stability_reward\n\n    # Reward dictionary\n    reward_dict = {\n        \"forward_vel_reward\": forward_vel_reward,\n        \"upright_reward\": upright_reward,\n        \"stability_reward\": stability_reward\n    }\n\n    return total_reward, reward_dict\n```\n\n### Summary of Changes:\n- **Forward Velocity**: Increased temperature for sharper incentives toward high speed.\n- **Upright**: Heavily redefined with a focus on alignment without assuming perfect upright as the baseline.\n- **Stability**: Heightened sensitivity to angular changes for greater precision in execution.\n\nThis revamped reward function aims to address the identified issues and promote better, more sustainable agent performance aligned with task objectives."
