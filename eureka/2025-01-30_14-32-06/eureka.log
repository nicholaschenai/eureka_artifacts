To design a reward function for the Ant environment that encourages the agent to run forward as fast as possible, we can focus on maximizing the velocity of the agent towards the target direction and maintaining an upright posture. Here's a proposed reward function:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, potentials: torch.Tensor, prev_potentials: torch.Tensor, up_vec: torch.Tensor, heading_vec: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract relevant components from root_states
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]
    
    # Calculate velocity towards the target
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    to_target[:, 2] = 0.0
    target_direction = torch.nn.functional.normalize(to_target, dim=-1)
    forward_vel = torch.sum(velocity * target_direction, dim=-1)
    
    # Reward for forward velocity
    forward_vel_reward = forward_vel
    
    # Upright reward component
    up_vector_expected = torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0, 1.0], device=root_states.device).expand_as(up_vec)
    upright_reward = torch.sum(up_vec * up_vector_expected, dim=-1)

    # Normalizing and transforming the reward components
    forward_vel_temperature = 0.1  # Temperature for forward velocity
    upright_temperature = 0.1      # Temperature for upright posture

    forward_vel_reward_transformed = torch.exp(forward_vel_temperature * forward_vel_reward) - 1.0
    upright_reward_transformed = torch.exp(upright_temperature * upright_reward) - 1.0

    # Total reward
    reward = forward_vel_reward_transformed + upright_reward_transformed

    # Construct the reward dictionary
    reward_dict = {
        "forward_vel_reward": forward_vel_reward,
        "upright_reward": upright_reward
    }

    return reward, reward_dict
```

### Explanation
1. **Forward Velocity Reward**: The reward is focused on the velocity in the direction of the target by computing the dot product of the velocity vector with the normalized direction towards the target. This encourages the agent to increase its speed towards the target location.

2. **Upright Reward**: The dot product of the up vector of the agent with the [0, 0, 1] vector (which represents the up direction) gives a measure of how upright the agent is. This promotes maintaining an upright posture while running.

3. **Normalization and Transformation**: The reward components are transformed using an exponential function with a temperature parameter. This helps to stabilize learning and provides a normalized range for rewards. Each component has its own temperature parameter to adjust sensitivity. 

This reward function focuses on speed and balance, essential for making the ant run forward effectively.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 300 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
forward_vel_reward: ['0.01', '6.49', '7.97', '8.88', '9.07', '9.53', '9.80', '9.61', '9.72', '9.88'], Max: 10.05, Mean: 8.63, Min: -0.02 
upright_reward: ['0.97', '0.91', '0.91', '0.91', '0.91', '0.93', '0.92', '0.91', '0.92', '0.91'], Max: 0.97, Mean: 0.91, Min: 0.43 
task_score: ['0.01', '6.48', '7.95', '8.86', '9.05', '9.51', '9.78', '9.59', '9.69', '9.85'], Max: 10.02, Mean: 8.61, Min: -0.02 
episode_lengths: ['46.25', '885.58', '922.44', '935.52', '913.49', '943.03', '949.27', '917.21', '924.02', '937.89'], Max: 964.68, Mean: 904.23, Min: 46.25 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Analyzing the policy feedback, one key observation is that the `upright_reward` remains nearly constant throughout the training epochs, showing little optimization. This suggests the need to re-work this component, possibly by enhancing its sensitivity or influence on the overall reward.

The `forward_vel_reward` has a broader range and shows positive progression. However, tuning might still be necessary to better balance the rewards between speed and posture.

The `task_score` closely follows the `forward_vel_reward`, indicating the latter's dominant role in determining the overall task score.

Considering these factors, let's revise the reward function by adjusting the scaling and transformation of both components, and ensure the upright reward is more influential.

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, potentials: torch.Tensor, prev_potentials: torch.Tensor, up_vec: torch.Tensor, heading_vec: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract relevant components from root_states
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]
    
    # Calculate velocity towards the target
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    to_target[:, 2] = 0.0
    target_direction = torch.nn.functional.normalize(to_target, dim=-1)
    forward_vel = torch.sum(velocity * target_direction, dim=-1)
   
    # Adjusted Reward for forward velocity
    forward_vel_temperature = 0.05  # Adjusted temperature for forward velocity
    forward_vel_reward = torch.exp(forward_vel_temperature * forward_vel) - 1.0

    # Revised Upright reward component
    up_vector_expected = torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0, 1.0], device=root_states.device).expand_as(up_vec)
    dot_prod_up = torch.sum(up_vec * up_vector_expected, dim=-1)
    # Apply scaling and a transformation
    upright_temperature = 0.5  # Increased temperature to enhance sensitivity
    upright_reward = torch.exp(upright_temperature * (dot_prod_up - 1.0))

    # Total reward is a weighted sum of the components
    total_reward = 1.0 * forward_vel_reward + 0.5 * upright_reward

    # Construct the reward dictionary
    reward_dict = {
        "forward_vel_reward": forward_vel_reward,
        "upright_reward": upright_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Changes and Rationale
1. **Forward Velocity Reward**: The forward velocity temperature parameter is reduced, expecting subtler changes in the reward function to maintain optimization but prevent overwhelming influence compared to other components.

2. **Upright Reward**: The transformation function for keeping the ant upright has been significantly increased in temperature, aiming to provide a more noticeable influence in encouraging the posture's optimization. 

3. **Total Reward**: The combination now involves a weighted sum, with more weight assigned to `forward_vel_reward` as it is more responsive, and a proportionally significant role for `upright_reward` to induce its impact.

This revised reward function aims to balance the importance of running forward quickly and maintaining an upright posture, increasing the robustness and effectiveness of the learned policy.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 300 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
forward_vel_reward: ['0.00', '0.33', '0.48', '0.57', '0.62', '0.64', '0.66', '0.67', '0.67', '0.69'], Max: 0.71, Mean: 0.57, Min: 0.00 
upright_reward: ['0.99', '0.98', '0.98', '0.99', '0.99', '1.00', '1.00', '1.00', '0.99', '1.00'], Max: 1.00, Mean: 0.99, Min: 0.79 
task_score: ['0.01', '5.64', '7.72', '8.84', '9.52', '9.75', '9.97', '10.07', '10.06', '10.32'], Max: 10.54, Mean: 8.75, Min: -0.03 
episode_lengths: ['47.00', '882.55', '940.75', '991.31', '991.70', '994.45', '992.65', '986.57', '989.20', '997.60'], Max: 1000.00, Mean: 962.68, Min: 47.00 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Based on the provided policy feedback, we observe the following points:

1. **Forward Velocity Reward**: Although there is improvement over time, the range (0.00 to 0.71) suggests that the agent struggles to achieve high velocities consistently. This reward component appears to increase, but it still signifies a lack of sufficient encouragement for speed. We may consider scaling up its influence or adjusting its transformation slightly.

2. **Upright Reward**: The values remain very consistent (0.79 to 1.00, with a mean of 0.99), implying that the upright posture is not a challenge for the agent. Given the high consistency, it might be either deemphasized slightly or reworked if deemed less critical.

3. **Task Score and Episode Lengths**: The task score shows continuous improvement, mirroring the improvement in `forward_vel_reward`, and the episodes lengthen, indicating progress in task completion. However, optimization in these areas can be further enhanced by exploring additional reward components or tuning existing ones.

To encourage more robust performance and speed while maintaining posture, here's an improved reward function:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, potentials: torch.Tensor, prev_potentials: torch.Tensor, up_vec: torch.Tensor, heading_vec: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract relevant components from root_states
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]
    
    # Calculate velocity towards the target
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    to_target[:, 2] = 0.0
    target_direction = torch.nn.functional.normalize(to_target, dim=-1)
    forward_vel = torch.sum(velocity * target_direction, dim=-1)
    
    # Adjusted Reward for forward velocity
    forward_vel_temperature = 0.1  # Increased temperature for further encouragement
    forward_vel_reward = torch.exp(forward_vel_temperature * forward_vel) - 1.0

    # Keeping a moderate Upright reward component
    up_vector_expected = torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0, 1.0], device=root_states.device).expand_as(up_vec)
    dot_prod_up = torch.sum(up_vec * up_vector_expected, dim=-1)
    upright_temperature = 0.3  # Reduced temperature to moderate influence
    upright_reward = torch.exp(upright_temperature * (dot_prod_up - 1.0))
    
    # Added Stability Reward for smooth motion
    ang_velocity = root_states[:, 10:13]
    stability_temperature = 0.2
    stability_reward = torch.exp(-stability_temperature * torch.norm(ang_velocity, p=2, dim=-1))  # Penalize angular movement

    # Total reward is a weighted sum of the components
    total_reward = 1.0 * forward_vel_reward + 0.25 * upright_reward + 0.25 * stability_reward

    # Construct the reward dictionary
    reward_dict = {
        "forward_vel_reward": forward_vel_reward,
        "upright_reward": upright_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Changes and Rationale:
1. **Forward Velocity Reward**: The temperature is increased to emphasize its importance, promoting faster movements towards goals.

2. **Upright Reward**: Temperature adjustment allows for maintaining functional influence while not overpowering velocity incentives.

3. **Stability Reward**: New component introduced to encourage smooth, stable motion by minimizing unnecessary angular velocity, aimed at reducing abrupt or erratic behavior.

This refined reward function aims to align the agent's progress with the desired outcomes more tightly, encouraging quick advancement while preserving stable and upright motions.

        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Based on the feedback:

1. **Forward Velocity Reward**: Values have improved and show variance, but there's room for further enhancement in achieving even higher velocities more consistently. The current scaling seems suitable, but further encouraging consistently high-speed movement might be beneficial.

2. **Upright Reward**: The values are stable and maxed out, indicating little optimization impact. Since maintaining up posture is less challenging, this component could either be deemphasized further or redefined to include a broader aspect of well-being for the posture.

3. **Stability Reward**: While lower than other rewards, it appears to consistently plateau. Adjusting scaling or further transformation could better reward smooth, continuous movements.

4. **General Trends**: Task scores and episode lengths are increasing, indicating improving performance. There's still a gap between the max task score and episode length that may indicate the room for improvement in maintaining long successful runs.

Here is a refined reward function that builds on these observations:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, potentials: torch.Tensor, prev_potentials: torch.Tensor, up_vec: torch.Tensor, heading_vec: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract relevant components from root_states
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]
    
    # Calculate velocity towards the target
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    to_target[:, 2] = 0.0
    target_direction = torch.nn.functional.normalize(to_target, dim=-1)
    forward_vel = torch.sum(velocity * target_direction, dim=-1)
    
    # Refined Reward for forwarding velocity
    forward_vel_temperature = 0.2  # Further amplify forward Vel
    forward_vel_reward = torch.exp(forward_vel_temperature * forward_vel) - 1.0

    # Redefine Upright Reward to include a modest penalty for deviation from upright
    up_vector_expected = torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0, 1.0], device=root_states.device).expand_as(up_vec)
    dot_prod_up = torch.sum(up_vec * up_vector_expected, dim=-1)
    upright_temperature = 0.1  # Scaled down to reduce influence 
    upright_reward = (dot_prod_up - 0.9)  # Narrow tolerance area

    # Stability Reward adjustment for better range
    ang_velocity = root_states[:, 10:13]
    smoothness_temperature = 0.1  # Reduced to increase differentiation
    stability_reward = torch.exp(-smoothness_temperature * torch.norm(ang_velocity, p=2, dim=-1))

    # Total reward with adjusted weightings
    total_reward = 1.0 * forward_vel_reward + 0.15 * upright_reward + 0.3 * stability_reward

    # Construct the reward dictionary
    reward_dict = {
        "forward_vel_reward": forward_vel_reward,
        "upright_reward": upright_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Adjustments and Rationale:
1. **Forward Velocity Reward**: Temperature increment serves to further push for higher maximum sustained speeds.
   
2. **Upright Reward**: The upright component is redefined with a modest penalty for variance from perfect upright, representing a more nuanced assessment than previously.
   
3. **Stability Reward**: Adjusted to allow for finer gradations, promoting smoother movements by reducing temperature to make minor improvements count more.

These adjustments aim to continue the current progress trends with better emphasis where needed, ultimately leading to higher task scores and consistent long-duration success.

[2025-01-31 02:59:11,567][root][INFO] - Iteration 3: User Content:
We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 300 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
forward_vel_reward: ['0.01', '2.32', '3.85', '5.06', '6.24', '7.08', '7.73', '8.25', '8.35', '7.93'], Max: 8.70, Mean: 6.07, Min: 0.01 
upright_reward: ['0.07', '0.01', '0.01', '0.01', '0.01', '0.01', '0.01', '0.00', '0.01', '-0.02'], Max: 0.07, Mean: 0.00, Min: -0.46 
stability_reward: ['0.63', '0.68', '0.67', '0.66', '0.65', '0.65', '0.66', '0.65', '0.65', '0.64'], Max: 0.74, Mean: 0.66, Min: 0.60 
task_score: ['0.01', '5.57', '7.24', '8.22', '8.93', '9.44', '9.76', '10.11', '10.10', '9.68'], Max: 10.26, Mean: 8.46, Min: 0.00 
episode_lengths: ['46.67', '843.30', '874.79', '885.66', '898.26', '916.52', '887.00', '912.93', '894.15', '858.23'], Max: 1000.00, Mean: 874.48, Min: 46.67 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Based on the provided feedback, let's analyze each component of the reward function:

1. **Forward Velocity Reward**:
   - Strong upward trend but plateaus towards the end. This indicates a good push towards the goal but possibly a limit due to lack of balancing or overly aggressive actions. Slightly higher penalties might be needed for instability.

2. **Upright Reward**:
   - Values are very low and almost unchanged, indicating little impact. This suggests it might not effectively encourage a proper upright posture. A reevaluation with a stronger or more dynamic component might be in order.

3. **Stability Reward**:
   - Values show minor variations, suggesting insufficient sensitivity to variations in smoothness. Consider reformulating to better incentivize continuous and stable control.

4. **Global Metrics**:
   - Success rates and episode lengths showcase significant early improvements, indicating a generally sound system. However, lengths plateauing below maximum suggest inconsistencies perhaps due to small stability issues or a need for more explorative policies.

Considering these insights, we'll make the following adjustments and improvements to the reward function:

- **Forward Velocity Reward**: Continue using the exponential transformation but adjust the temperature for a sharper reward to promote greater speeds.
- **Upright Reward**: Reformulate entirely using a different approach, such as relative angle between up_vec and desired orientation vector, and increase its influence.
- **Stability Reward**: Increase sensitivity by adjusting temperature and look for other cues on control stability.

Here's the refined reward function:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, potentials: torch.Tensor, prev_potentials: torch.Tensor, up_vec: torch.Tensor, heading_vec: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract components from the state
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]
    ang_velocity = root_states[:, 10:13]

    # Forward Velocity Reward
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    to_target[:, 2] = 0.0
    target_direction = torch.nn.functional.normalize(to_target, dim=-1)
    forward_vel = torch.sum(velocity * target_direction, dim=-1)
    forward_vel_temperature = 0.25  # Adjusted for sharper reward
    forward_vel_reward = torch.exp(forward_vel_temperature * forward_vel) - 1.0

    # New Upright Reward
    upright_temperature = 1.5  # Strong encouragement for consistent posture
    up_vector_expected = torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0, 1.0], device=root_states.device).expand_as(up_vec)
    upright_similarity = torch.sum(up_vec * up_vector_expected, dim=-1)
    upright_reward = torch.exp(upright_temperature * (upright_similarity - 1.0))

    # Stability Reward
    stability_temperature = 0.5  # Fine-tuned to promote reduced angular velocities
    stability_reward = torch.exp(-stability_temperature * torch.norm(ang_velocity, p=2, dim=-1))

    # Total Reward
    total_reward = 1.0 * forward_vel_reward + 0.3 * upright_reward + 0.2 * stability_reward

    # Reward dictionary
    reward_dict = {
        "forward_vel_reward": forward_vel_reward,
        "upright_reward": upright_reward,
        "stability_reward": stability_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Summary of Changes:
- **Forward Velocity**: Increased temperature for sharper incentives toward high speed.
- **Upright**: Heavily redefined with a focus on alignment without assuming perfect upright as the baseline.
- **Stability**: Heightened sensitivity to angular changes for greater precision in execution.

This revamped reward function aims to address the identified issues and promote better, more sustainable agent performance aligned with task objectives.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 300 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
forward_vel_reward: ['0.02', '4.45', '7.71', '10.00', '12.17', '13.78', '15.40', '17.23', '17.72', '18.50'], Max: 20.63, Mean: 12.78, Min: 0.02 
upright_reward: ['0.96', '0.91', '0.93', '0.93', '0.93', '0.93', '0.93', '0.94', '0.93', '0.94'], Max: 0.96, Mean: 0.93, Min: 0.61 
stability_reward: ['0.15', '0.17', '0.17', '0.17', '0.17', '0.17', '0.17', '0.17', '0.18', '0.19'], Max: 0.24, Mean: 0.17, Min: 0.13 
task_score: ['0.01', '6.18', '7.92', '8.69', '9.32', '9.76', '10.11', '10.53', '10.49', '10.62'], Max: 11.08, Mean: 9.03, Min: -0.00

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
