As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.).

        "content": "Based on the feedback provided, let's analyze each component of the reward function and subsequently update it:\n\n1. **Transformed Velocity Reward**:\n   - This component shows a steadily increasing range with a notably high maximum value compared to other components. This suggests that it's being significantly optimized by the RL policy.\n   - To further balance its influence, we may want to readjust its temperature slightly to ensure harmony across components.\n\n2. **Uprightness Reward**:\n   - The values are relatively stable and quite similar, showing limited variance, which indicates this component is not being effectively optimized.\n   - We'll consider adjusting its temperature for more sensitivity or rewriting it to focus on different aspects of stability, such as penalizing positions deviating from intended orientation.\n\n3. **Task Score**:\n   - Similar to the velocity reward, it shows progressive improvement, but still has a considerably wide range.\n   - We should add a reward for achieving and maintaining high speeds to encourage the humanoid to sustain it alongside stability.\n\n4. **Episode Lengths**:\n   - The episode lengths greatly improve over time, reaching mean values near 900, indicating extensive learning but still some episodes end prematurely.\n\nGiven these analyses, let's rewrite the reward function to address these aspects:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Tuple, Dict\n\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, potentials: torch.Tensor, prev_potentials: torch.Tensor, up_vec: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Velocity reward component\n    velocity_reward = potentials - prev_potentials\n    \n    # Adjusted transformation temperature\n    velocity_temp = 0.2  # Further decreasing for balanced influence\n    transformed_velocity_reward = torch.exp(velocity_reward * velocity_temp) - 1.0\n\n    # Rewritten enhanced uprightness reward\n    orientation_deviation = 1.0 - up_vec[:, 2]\n    uprightness_reward = torch.exp(-orientation_deviation * 5.0)  # Increased sensitivity\n\n    # New high-speed maintenance reward\n    speed_reward = torch.clamp(velocity_reward, min=0.0)  # Encourages maintaining high speeds\n\n    # Balancing total reward with new components\n    total_reward = 0.5 * transformed_velocity_reward + 0.3 * uprightness_reward + 0.2 * speed_reward\n\n    # Collect reward components for diagnostics\n    reward_dict = {\n        \"transformed_velocity_reward\": transformed_velocity_reward,\n        \"uprightness_reward\": uprightness_reward,\n        \"speed_reward\": speed_reward\n    }\n\n    return total_reward, reward_dict\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **Velocity Reward**: Downscaled the transformation to balance its impact with revised temperature.\n\n2. **Uprightness Reward**: Adjusted to emphasize stability with a more significant temperature parameter, aiming for substantial variance and sensitivity to deviations.\n\n3. **Speed Reward**: Newly added to promote and sustain high speeds, leveraging the velocity_reward's value.\n\n4. **Final Reward Composition**: Altered weights to balance speed with stability, ensuring the humanoid doesn't reach maximum speed at the cost of falling over. By recalibrating the function with these improvements, the reward should promote both high velocity and steadfast performance."
