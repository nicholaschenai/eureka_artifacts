As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.).

We can slightly reduce its weight to emphasize more critical tasks.\n\n2. **Open Reward**:\n   - The values are steadily increasing but remain low overall. This indicates that the agent is starting to open the drawer but not very effectively. We can rescale or adjust the temperature to encourage more efficient opening.\n\n3. **Completion Bonus**:\n   - With zero values throughout, this indicates failure in recognizing task completion. We need to re-evaluate and potentially include a stronger deterministic condition for completion.\n\n4. **Task Score**:\n   - Also at near zero, parallel to the completion bonus. Suggests task success isn't clearly defined or emphasized in the current setup.\n\n5. **Episode Lengths**:\n   - Approaching maximum values, indicating episodes are taking too long, suggesting inefficiency in reaching the task completion, likely due to inadequately rewarding successful drawer opening.\n\nThe revised reward function must emphasize task completion (drawer opening) more significantly and improve the rewards structure.
