To write a reward function for the task of opening a cabinet door using the environment description provided, I'll consider the relevant observations and derive a reward function based on them. The primary objective would be encouraging the Franka arm to open the door which can be achieved by increasing the angle or position value associated with the door's opening. We will also encourage the arm to reduce the distance between the gripper and the handle of the door. Here's how the reward function can be designed:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(franka_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor, 
                   drawer_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor, 
                   cabinet_dof_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Reward for distance to the handle of the door
    distance_to_handle = torch.norm(franka_grasp_pos - drawer_grasp_pos, p=2, dim=-1)
    distance_reward_temperature = 0.1
    distance_reward = torch.exp(-distance_to_handle / distance_reward_temperature)

    # Reward for opening the door, assumed to be the 4th dof in cabinet_dof_pos
    door_opening_reward_temperature = 0.1
    door_opening_reward = torch.exp(cabinet_dof_pos[:, 3] / door_opening_reward_temperature)

    # Total reward calculation
    total_reward = distance_reward + door_opening_reward

    # Return the total reward and a breakdown of the individual components
    reward_dict = {
        'distance_reward': distance_reward,
        'door_opening_reward': door_opening_reward
    }
    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Explanation
1. **Distance to Handle**: 
   - We calculate the Euclidean distance between the Franka gripper's position (`franka_grasp_pos`) and the door's handle position (`drawer_grasp_pos`).
   - A reward is given that decreases exponentially as the distance increases. This guides the arm towards the door handle.
   - A temperature parameter (`distance_reward_temperature`) is introduced to control the sensitivity of this reward.

2. **Door Opening**: 
   - We assume that the degree of opening the door can be read from `cabinet_dof_pos[:, 3]` (as mentioned in the input).
   - A positive reward is given, which increases as the door is opened more. This also uses an exponential transformation with an associated temperature parameter (`door_opening_reward_temperature`).

3. **Normalization and Composition**: 
   - Both rewards are designed to favorably guide the arm towards opening the door.
   - The rewards are combined to form a final reward, encouraging both proximity to the handle and successful door opening.

This reward function should encourage behaviors that open the cabinet door effectively.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 300 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
distance_reward: ['0.01', '0.03', '0.04', '0.04', '0.04', '0.05', '0.04', '0.04', '0.05', '0.04'], Max: 0.55, Mean: 0.05, Min: 0.01 
door_opening_reward: ['1.00', '30.12', '32.31', '34.10', '34.11', '32.14', '34.78', '34.74', '35.53', '37.54'], Max: 38.72, Mean: 32.71, Min: 1.00 
task_score: ['0.00', '0.10', '0.12', '0.05', '0.08', '0.06', '0.03', '0.05', '0.06', '0.02'], Max: 0.36, Mean: 0.07, Min: 0.00 
episode_lengths: ['499.00', '473.67', '477.51', '491.52', '458.12', '474.70', '492.34', '480.67', '492.58', '496.73'], Max: 500.00, Mean: 471.90, Min: 144.51 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Based on the analysis of the policy feedback, here are the observations and changes needed:

### Observations:
1. **Distance Reward**:
    - The values for the `distance_reward` component are fairly low and do not change significantly over epochs. This suggests that this component is not effectively guiding the learning process.
    - Action: Re-write to increase the scale or sensitivity, potentially by adjusting the temperature or formulation.

2. **Door Opening Reward**:
    - The `door_opening_reward` shows a large range with high maximum and mean values. This indicates it dominates the reward function, potentially overshadowing other components.
    - Action: Scale down this reward to balance it with others.

3. **Task Score and Episode Length**:
    - As the `task_score` remains low and episode lengths are near maximum, the agent is likely not completing the task efficiently.
    - Comprehensive re-evaluation or addition of penalties might be necessary to encourage efficiency and success.

### Improved Reward Function:
I will introduce a penalty for high distance, potentially with a scaling factor for the door opening reward to normalize its influence. Here's the updated reward function:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(franka_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor, 
                   drawer_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor, 
                   cabinet_dof_pos: torch.Tensor, 
                   cabinet_dof_vel: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Improved Distance Reward
    distance_to_handle = torch.norm(franka_grasp_pos - drawer_grasp_pos, p=2, dim=-1)
    distance_reward_temperature = 0.3  # Increased sensitivity
    distance_reward = 1.0 / (1.0 + distance_to_handle / distance_reward_temperature)

    # Improved Door Opening Reward
    door_opening_reward_temperature = 0.3  # Adjusted to reduce influence
    door_opening_reward = torch.exp(cabinet_dof_pos[:, 3] / door_opening_reward_temperature)

    # Penalty for not changing the door state (encourages actual door movement)
    door_velocity = cabinet_dof_vel[:, 3]
    movement_penalty_temperature = 0.2
    movement_penalty = torch.exp(-torch.abs(door_velocity) / movement_penalty_temperature)

    # Total reward calculation with scaled contributions
    total_reward = 0.5 * distance_reward + 0.3 * door_opening_reward - 0.2 * movement_penalty

    # Return the total reward and component breakdown
    reward_dict = {
        'distance_reward': distance_reward,
        'door_opening_reward': door_opening_reward,
        'movement_penalty': movement_penalty
    }
    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Explanation:
- **Enhanced Distance Reward**: Reformulated the inverse distance reward for sharper guidance while improving utility by adjusting the temperature.
- **Scaled Door Opening Reward**: Temperature adjustment to reduce excessive magnitude; continues to motivate successful door-opening.
- **Movement Penalty**: New penalty for not actively changing the door's state to prevent stalling and promote meaningful interactions.
- **Weighted Total Reward**: Comprehensive calculation with proper scaling to balance incentives across different components.

This restructured reward function should address the feedback and guide the agent to learn the task of opening the cabinet door more effectively.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 300 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
distance_reward: ['0.40', '0.82', '0.86', '0.92', '0.83', '0.77', '0.79', '0.81', '0.81', '0.89'], Max: 0.93, Mean: 0.83, Min: 0.36

task_score: ['0.00', '0.07', '0.01', '0.03', '0.06', '0.03', '0.02', '0.01', '0.04', '0.02'], Max: 0.15, Mean: 0.03, Min: 0.00 
episode_lengths: ['272.00', '490.07', '492.95', '493.02', '496.14', '498.18', '497.69', '496.63', '485.91', '477.42'], Max: 500.00, Mean: 487.25, Min: 135.60 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Based on the analysis of the policy feedback, here's a summary followed by an improved reward function.

### Feedback Analysis:
1. **Distance Reward**:
    - **Remarks**: The distance reward is relatively stable, with values between 0.36 and 0.93, but improvements can be made by focusing on reducing variance and increasing its influence.

2. **Door Opening Reward**:
    - **Remarks**: This has the highest magnitude, up to 3.43. It shows significant variability, indicating it’s a strong driving factor. However, we need to scale it down to avoid overshadowing other components.

3. **Movement Penalty**:
    - **Remarks**: This component seems to be decently active with values near 1.00 at times. It's doing well in penalizing lack of movement but can be tuned for more strategic influence.

4. **Task Score and Episode Lengths**:
    - **Remarks**: The task score is very low, and episode lengths are quite high, indicating the agent is frequently failing or becoming stuck. We need to incorporate changes that ensure faster and more successful completion.

### Improved Reward Function:
After evaluating the feedback, I will rescale the door opening reward, refine the distance reward to improve sensitivity, and adjust the penalty for lack of movement while considering task completion incentives.

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(franka_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor, 
                   drawer_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor, 
                   cabinet_dof_pos: torch.Tensor, 
                   cabinet_dof_vel: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Enhanced Distance Reward
    distance_to_handle = torch.norm(franka_grasp_pos - drawer_grasp_pos, p=2, dim=-1)
    distance_reward_temperature = 0.25
    distance_reward = torch.exp(-distance_to_handle / distance_reward_temperature)

    # Rescaled Door Opening Reward
    door_opening_reward_temperature = 0.15
    scaled_door_opening = torch.exp(cabinet_dof_pos[:, 3] / door_opening_reward_temperature) - 1.0

    # Refined Movement Penalty
    door_velocity = cabinet_dof_vel[:, 3]
    movement_penalty_temperature = 0.15
    movement_penalty = torch.exp(-torch.abs(door_velocity) / movement_penalty_temperature)

    # Task Completion Incentive
    task_completion = (cabinet_dof_pos[:, 3] > 0.5).float()  # Reward for opening past a threshold
    task_completion_reward = task_completion * 2.0  # Strong incentive for task success

    # Total reward
    total_reward = 0.3 * distance_reward + 0.3 * scaled_door_opening - 0.2 * movement_penalty + 0.2 * task_completion_reward

    # Return the total reward and component breakdown
    reward_dict = {
        'distance_reward': distance_reward,
        'door_opening_reward': scaled_door_opening,
        'movement_penalty': movement_penalty,
        'task_completion_reward': task_completion_reward
    }
    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Explanation:
- **Distance Reward**: Made more sensitive and effective in reducing the gap between the hand and target.
- **Door Opening Reward**: Rescaled with a smaller temperature parameter to balance its influence.
- **Movement Penalty**: Adjusted for more strategic disincentive against lack of motion, improving influence on dynamic progress.
- **Task Completion Reward**: Introduced a new incentive for reaching a substantial door opening threshold, motivating real task accomplishment.
- **Balanced Total Reward**: Combined components in ratios that ensure cooperative progression towards task achievements.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Analyzing the provided feedback, it is apparent that the current reward function requires adjustments for better task success:

### Feedback Analysis:
1. **Distance Reward**:
   - **Remarks**: Shows a small range with low variance, indicating insufficient influence on the agent's learning. This may need rescaling or redefining.

2. **Door Opening Reward**:
   - **Remarks**: Has a large magnitude and minimal variability. It dominates other components, requiring scaling down to balance the reward influence.

3. **Movement Penalty**:
   - **Remarks**: The magnitude is high and shows little variation, which suggests it's not contributing effectively. We should reassess its purpose and magnitude.

4. **Task Completion Reward**:
   - **Remarks**: Zero values across all epochs indicate non-functionality. It must be revised or re-introduced with clear conditions.

5. **Global Metrics**:
   - **Remarks**: Low task scores and long episode lengths suggest ineffective task completion. With success rates near zero, the reward function needs a rework.


### Revised Reward Function Proposal:
The new reward function will introduce a sharper focus on target distance, moderate the door opening reward, enhance the movement penalty's effectiveness, and reintroduce the task completion incentive with clearer conditions.

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(franka_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor, 
                   drawer_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor, 
                   cabinet_dof_pos: torch.Tensor, 
                   cabinet_dof_vel: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Enhanced Distance Reward
    distance_to_handle = torch.norm(franka_grasp_pos - drawer_grasp_pos, p=2, dim=-1)
    distance_reward_temperature = 0.10
    distance_reward = torch.exp(-distance_to_handle / distance_reward_temperature)

    # Controlled Door Opening Reward
    door_opening_reward_temperature = 0.05
    door_opening_reward = torch.exp(cabinet_dof_pos[:, 3] / door_opening_reward_temperature) - 1.0

    # Refined Movement Penalty
    velocity_threshold = 0.02
    velocity_condition = (torch.abs(cabinet_dof_vel[:, 3]) > velocity_threshold).float()
    movement_penalty_temperature = 0.05
    movement_penalty = velocity_condition * torch.exp(-torch.abs(cabinet_dof_vel[:, 3]) / movement_penalty_temperature)

    # RIntroduced Task Completion Incentive
    completion_condition = (cabinet_dof_pos[:, 3] > 0.7).float()  # Adjusted threshold for door opening completion
    task_completion_reward = completion_condition * 5.0  # Strongly incentivizes completion once achieved

    # Total reward
    total_reward = 0.3 * distance_reward + 0.2 * door_opening_reward - 0.1 * movement_penalty + 0.4 * task_completion_reward

    # Return the total reward and component breakdown
    reward_dict = {
        'distance_reward': distance_reward,
        'door_opening_reward': door_opening_reward,
        'movement_penalty': movement_penalty,
        'task_completion_reward': task_completion_reward
    }
    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Strategy Explanation:
- **Distance Reward**: Increased sensitivity to encourage grasp precision.
- **Door Opening Reward**: Reduced influence by scaling and balancing factor to ensure it does not overpower others.
- **Movement Penalty**: Utilizes a velocity condition for better regulation against inefficient movements.
- **Task Completion Reward**: Introduced revised condition with significant reward to prioritize task completion.
- **Balanced Total Reward**: Ratios adjusted for complementary progression toward door opening task success.

Based on the feedback and the performance metrics collected during the policy training, several key insights and adjustments are necessary for improving the reward function:

### Feedback Analysis:
1. **Distance Reward**:
   - **Remarks**: The range is small with low variance, which suggests an insufficient effect on learning. We'll consider increasing the influence by rescaling.

2. **Door Opening Reward**:
   - **Remarks**: Its magnitude is excessively large, making it overwhelming compared to other components. This needs substantial scaling down.

3. **Movement Penalty**:
   - **Remarks**: Almost no variation and minimal impact, indicating it's not being optimized. Evaluate its utility and possibly integrate differently.

4. **Task Completion Reward**:
   - **Remarks**: Zero across all epochs suggests that this component is non-functional. It might need repurposing or reintroduction under new conditions.

5. **Global Metrics**:
   - **Remarks**: Persistent low task scores and maximum episode lengths indicate poor task completion rates. Consequently, the reward function merits thorough redesign.

### Revised Reward Function Proposal:
The new reward function revamps components to increase actionable insight for the agent while ensuring balance among rewards:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(franka_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor, 
                   drawer_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor, 
                   cabinet_dof_pos: torch.Tensor, 
                   cabinet_dof_vel: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Rescaled Distance Reward
    distance_to_handle = torch.norm(franka_grasp_pos - drawer_grasp_pos, p=2, dim=-1)
    distance_reward_temperature = 0.2  # Adjusted for more prominence
    distance_reward = 1.0 - torch.tanh(distance_to_handle / distance_reward_temperature)

    # Rescaled Door Opening Reward
    door_opening_reward_temperature = 500.0  # Significantly increased to reduce influence
    door_opening_reward = cabinet_dof_pos[:, 3] / door_opening_reward_temperature

    # Refined Movement Penalty
    movement_penalty_temperature = 0.1  # Increased for noticeable effect
    movement_penalty = torch.exp(-torch.abs(cabinet_dof_vel[:, 3]) / movement_penalty_temperature)

    # Revamped Task Completion Reward
    completion_threshold = 0.7  # Threshold for door considered open
    task_completion_reward = (cabinet_dof_pos[:, 3] >= completion_threshold).float() * 10.0  # Substantial bonus to emphasize completion

    # Total reward
    total_reward = 0.25 * distance_reward + 0.25 * door_opening_reward - 0.25 * movement_penalty + 0.25 * task_completion_reward

    # Return the total reward and component breakdown
    reward_dict = {
        'distance_reward': distance_reward,
        'door_opening_reward': door_opening_reward,
        'movement_penalty': movement_penalty,
        'task_completion_reward': task_completion_reward
    }
    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Strategy Explanation:
- **Distance Reward**: Temperature is reduced, incentivizing reduction of handle distance more actively.
- **Door Opening Reward**: Cooling down exponent influence to prevent overwhelming.
- **Movement Penalty**: Adjusted the temperature to distinguish effectively from reward components.
- **Task Completion Reward**: Enhanced clarity and incentivization for completion with a prominent reward.
- **Balanced Total Reward**: Ensures equitable contribution of each component for optimal learning progression.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 300 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
distance_reward: ['0.03', '0.68', '0.75', '0.79', '0.81', '0.81', '0.84', '0.85', '0.84', '0.82'], Max: 0.87, Mean: 0.77, Min: 0.01 
door_opening_reward: ['0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00'], Max: 0.00, Mean: 0.00, Min: 0.00 
movement_penalty: ['1.00', '0.29', '0.29', '0.24', '0.22', '0.20', '0.18', '0.17', '0.15', '0.16'], Max: 1.00, Mean: 0.24, Min: 0.13 
task_completion_reward: ['0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00'], Max: 0.00, Mean: 0.00, Min: 0.00 
task_score: ['0.00', '0.31', '0.09', '0.15', '0.01', '0.05', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.02'], Max: 0.99, Mean: 0.08, Min: 0.00 
episode_lengths: ['417.00', '494.17', '493.55', '486.33', '482.32', '499.82', '500.00', '500.00', '498.83', '499.13'], Max: 500.00, Mean: 474.74, Min: 105.89 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
