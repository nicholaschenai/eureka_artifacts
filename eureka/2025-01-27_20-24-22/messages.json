As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.).

        "content": "Based on the feedback and the performance metrics collected during the policy training, several key insights and adjustments are necessary for improving the reward function:\n\n### Feedback Analysis:\n1. **Distance Reward**:\n   - **Remarks**: The range is small with low variance, which suggests an insufficient effect on learning. We'll consider increasing the influence by rescaling.\n\n2. **Door Opening Reward**:\n   - **Remarks**: Its magnitude is excessively large, making it overwhelming compared to other components. This needs substantial scaling down.\n\n3. **Movement Penalty**:\n   - **Remarks**: Almost no variation and minimal impact, indicating it's not being optimized. Evaluate its utility and possibly integrate differently.\n\n4. **Task Completion Reward**:\n   - **Remarks**: Zero across all epochs suggests that this component is non-functional. It might need repurposing or reintroduction under new conditions.\n\n5. **Global Metrics**:\n   - **Remarks**: Persistent low task scores and maximum episode lengths indicate poor task completion rates. Consequently, the reward function merits thorough redesign.\n\n### Revised Reward Function Proposal:\nThe new reward function revamps components to increase actionable insight for the agent while ensuring balance among rewards:\n\n```python\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(franka_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor, \n                   drawer_grasp_pos: torch.Tensor, \n                   cabinet_dof_pos: torch.Tensor, \n                   cabinet_dof_vel: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Rescaled Distance Reward\n    distance_to_handle = torch.norm(franka_grasp_pos - drawer_grasp_pos, p=2, dim=-1)\n    distance_reward_temperature = 0.2  # Adjusted for more prominence\n    distance_reward = 1.0 - torch.tanh(distance_to_handle / distance_reward_temperature)\n\n    # Rescaled Door Opening Reward\n    door_opening_reward_temperature = 500.0  # Significantly increased to reduce influence\n    door_opening_reward = cabinet_dof_pos[:, 3] / door_opening_reward_temperature\n\n    # Refined Movement Penalty\n    movement_penalty_temperature = 0.1  # Increased for noticeable effect\n    movement_penalty = torch.exp(-torch.abs(cabinet_dof_vel[:, 3]) / movement_penalty_temperature)\n\n    # Revamped Task Completion Reward\n    completion_threshold = 0.7  # Threshold for door considered open\n    task_completion_reward = (cabinet_dof_pos[:, 3] >= completion_threshold).float() * 10.0  # Substantial bonus to emphasize completion\n\n    # Total reward\n    total_reward = 0.25 * distance_reward + 0.25 * door_opening_reward - 0.25 * movement_penalty + 0.25 * task_completion_reward\n\n    # Return the total reward and component breakdown\n    reward_dict = {\n        'distance_reward': distance_reward,\n        'door_opening_reward': door_opening_reward,\n        'movement_penalty': movement_penalty,\n        'task_completion_reward': task_completion_reward\n    }\n    return total_reward, reward_dict\n```\n\n### Strategy Explanation:\n- **Distance Reward**: Temperature is reduced, incentivizing reduction of handle distance more actively.\n- **Door Opening Reward**: Cooling down exponent influence to prevent overwhelming.\n- **Movement Penalty**: Adjusted the temperature to distinguish effectively from reward components.\n- **Task Completion Reward**: Enhanced clarity and incentivization for completion with a prominent reward.\n- **Balanced Total Reward**: Ensures equitable contribution of each component for optimal learning progression."

Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:\n    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function\n    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider\n        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter\n        (b) Re-writing the reward component \n        (c) Discarding the reward component\n    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range\nPlease analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable.
